                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>The 4th Industrial Revolution was the main topic of discussion at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2016. Dr. Klaus Schwab, the chairman of the WEF, has named it with an intention to describe how fast the world is changing driven by the so called disruptive technological advances and how deeply the lives of people are forced to alteration. These waves of changes will hit every region around the globe and everyone will be forced to change. Words of warning go viral such that an entity leading such changes will thrive while the others who are not prepared for them will perish. This has created a Tsunami of discussions at least within Korea where the winning performance of AlphaGo Spring 2016 has proven how powerful today's breakthrough technology could be. The impact is indisputable. Almost everyone agrees immediately. Even an ordinary people can grab the importance of preparedness right away. While some are awed by them, others perceive opening of enormously many new opportunities that advances of new technologies will take the human to the next level. As we study more, visons with concrete action plans are realized within leading nations such as Germany and U.S.A. with revolutionary outcomes being sprung up. For example, we see how Germans has renovated its old manufacturing industry under the theme of Smart Factory, a revolutionary idea incubated carefully executed for the last decade by Dr. Z?lke who coined the term Industry 4.0. The storm of discussions to date is to provide us with a chance to carefully thought out our future and prepare us to make the world a better place to live in. When we work together to shape out a desirable future, such a future will come true as reality someday. In this talk, I aim to discuss the narrative of 4th industrial revolution, showcase a selected set of fundamental technologies and thoughts deriving the effort, and discuss how they can be utilized to make a better future for all.</p>
